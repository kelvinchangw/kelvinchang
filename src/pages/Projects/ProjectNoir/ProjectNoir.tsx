                                    I started NOIR as a way to store all of my
                                    data that I had accumulated over the years.
                                    My main PC has a 2TB M.2 SSD and it was
                                    filling up ever so closely to the max. I
                                    dislike when storages are near or at
                                    capacity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    These are the specs of NOIR; you can look at
                                    it more in depth on its{" "}

                                    I did not need a dedicated GPU for what I
                                    wanted from NOIR so I opted for integrated
                                    Intel CPU graphics.
                                </p>

                                    The build process was somewhat simple, aside
                                    from me not having HDD data sata cables
                                    ready at the time of build. Somehow, it
                                    never occurred to me that a HDD needed a
                                    cable to power it and also another cable to
                                    transmit data...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Post build process, there were two exhaust
                                    fans that were not spinning. Originally I
                                    thought it was a compatibility issue with
                                    the fans' 3 pin headers and Meshify's built
                                    in Nexus+ 2 Fan Hub. Turns out I didn't plug
                                    in the Hub's PWM header into the MOBO...

                                    This was also my first time installing and
                                    working with a Linux based OS (aside from VM
                                    projects in university). TrueNAS feels great
                                    to use.

                                    Currently, I have the following running on
                                    NOIR.

                                    I thought to myself, wow is this really all
                                    I have on there? Yup.
                                </p>

                                    I considered Plex for media streaming, but I
                                    don't watch any shows or movies. Besides
                                    Arcane of course.

                                    The build process was recorded, and I am in
                                    the process of compiling and editing the
                                    footage for YouTube. ;)
